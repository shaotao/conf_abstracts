Opinion Dynamics with Varying Susceptibility to Persuasion,"A long line of work in social psychology has studied variations in people's susceptibility to persuasion -- the extent to which they are willing to modify their opinions on a topic. This body of literature suggests an interesting perspective on theoretical models of opinion formation on social networks: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify people's intrinsic opinions, it is also natural to consider those that modify people's susceptibility to persuasion. Here, we adopt a popular model for social opinion dynamics, and formalize the opinion maximization and minimization problems where interventions happen at the level of susceptibility. We show that modeling interventions at the level of susceptibility leads to an interesting family of new questions in network opinion dynamics. We find that the questions are quite different depending on whether there is an overall budget constraining the number of agents we can target or not. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal target-set to optimize the sum of opinions when there are no budget constraints on the size of the target-set. We show that this problem is NP-hard when there is a budget, and that the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. Finally, we propose a heuristic for the budgeted opinion optimization problem and show its efficacy at finding target-sets that optimize the sum of opinions on real world networks, including a Twitter network with real opinion estimates."
A Dual Markov Chain Topic Model for Dynamic Environments,"The abundance of digital text has led to extensive research on topic models that reason about documents using latent representations. Since for many online or streaming textual sources such as news outlets, the number, and nature of topics change over time, there have been several efforts that attempt to address such situations using dynamic versions of topic models. Unfortunately, existing approaches encounter more complex inferencing when their model parameters are varied over time, resulting in high computation complexity and performance degradation. This paper introduces the DM-DTM, a dual Markov chain dynamic topic model, for characterizing a corpus that evolves over time. This model uses a gamma Markov chain and a Dirichlet Markov chain to allow the topic popularities and word-topic assignments, respectively, to vary smoothly over time. Novel applications of the Negative-Binomial augmentation trick result in simple, efficient, closed-form updates of all the required conditional posteriors, resulting in far lower computational requirements as well as less sensitivity to initial conditions, as compared to existing approaches. Moreover, via a gamma process prior, the number of desired topics is inferred directly from the data rather than being pre-specified and can vary as the data changes. Empirical comparisons using multiple real-world corpora demonstrate a clear superiority of DM-DTM over strong baselines for both static and dynamic topic models."
Algorithms for Hiring and Outsourcing in the Online Labor Market,"Although freelancing work has grown substantially in recent years, in part facilitated by a number of online labor marketplaces, %(e.g., Guru, Freelancer, Amazon Mechanical Turk), traditional forms of ""in-sourcing"" work continue being the dominant form of employment. % in most companies. This means that, at least for the time being, freelancing and salaried employment will continue to co-exist. In this paper, we provide algorithms for outsourcing and hiring workers in a general setting, where workers form a team and contribute different skills to perform a task. We call this model team formation with outsourcing. In our model, tasks arrive in an online fashion: neither the number nor the composition of the tasks are known a-priori. At any point in time, there is a team of hired workers who receive a fixed salary independently of the work they perform. This team is dynamic: new members can be hired and existing members can be fired, at some cost. Additionally, some parts of the arriving tasks can be outsourced and thus completed by non-team members, at a premium. Our contribution is an efficient online cost-minimizing algorithm for hiring and firing team members and outsourcing tasks. We present theoretical bounds obtained using a primal--dual scheme proving that our algorithms have logarithmic competitive approximation ratio. We complement these results with experiments using semi-synthetic datasets based on actual task requirements and worker skills from three large online labor marketplaces."
Scalable k -Means Clustering via Lightweight Coresets,"\emphCoresets are compact representations of data sets such that models trained on a coreset are provably competitive with models trained on the full data set. As such, they have been successfully used to scale up clustering models to massive data sets. While existing approaches generally only allow for multiplicative approximation errors, we propose a novel notion of lightweight coresets that allows for both multiplicative and additive errors. We provide a single algorithm to construct lightweight coresets for k -means clustering as well as soft and hard Bregman clustering. The algorithm is substantially faster than existing constructions, embarrassingly parallel, and the resulting coresets are smaller. We further show that the proposed approach naturally generalizes to statistical k -means clustering and that, compared to existing results, it can be used to compute smaller summaries for empirical risk minimization. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing data summarization strategies in practice."
Discovering Models from Structural and Behavioral Brain Imaging Data,"Block models of graphs are used in a wide variety of domains as they find not only clusters (the blocks) but also interaction within and between the blocks. However, existing approaches primarily focus on either structural graphs (i.e. for MRI scans) or behavioral graphs (i.e. for fMRI scans). In both cases the block model's interaction or mixing matrix can be useful for understanding potential interaction (for structural graphs) and actual interaction (for behavioral graphs) between the blocks. In this paper we explore finding block models where there is both a structural network and multiple behavioral graphs. This provides significant modeling challenges, consider if there is strong behavioral connectivity but no structural connectivity between two nodes. We show why existing multi-graph settings such as multi-view learning are insufficient and instead propose a novel model to address the problem. Our method not only learns structurally and behaviorally cohesive blocks of nodes but also finds structurally and behaviorally feasible block interactions. We show in numerical evaluations on synthetic data that our method outperforms baseline approaches in recovering the ground-truth factor matrices in increasingly complex situations. We further apply our method to real-world datasets from two different domains (1) brain imaging data (a multi-cohort fMRI study) and to show its versatility (2) Twitter (following network and retweet behavior) and gain insights into the information flow and underlying generating mechanisms of these complex data."
Optimal Distributed Submodular Optimization via Sketching,"We present distributed algorithms for several classes of submodular optimization problems such as k-cover, set cover, facility location, and probabilistic coverage. The new algorithms enjoy almost optimal space complexity, optimal approximation guarantees, optimal communication complexity (and run in only four rounds of computation), addressing major shortcomings of prior work. We first present a distributed algorithm for k-cover using only Õ(n) space per machine, and then extend it to several submodular optimization problems, improving previous results for all the above problems-e.g., our algorithm for facility location problem improves the space of the best-known algorithm (Lindgren et al.). Our algorithms are implementable in various distributed frameworks such as MapReduce and RAM models. On the hardness side, we demonstrate the limitations of uniform sampling via an information theoretic argument. Furthermore, we perform an extensive empirical study of our algorithms (implemented in MapReduce) on a variety of datasets. We observe that using sketches 30-600 times smaller than the input, one can solve the coverage maximization problem with quality very close to that of the state-of-the-art single machine algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate an application of our algorithm in large-scale feature selection"
Sequences of Sets,"Sequential behavior such as sending emails, gathering in groups, tagging posts, or authoring academic papers may be characterized by a set of recipients, attendees, tags, or coauthors respectively. Such ""sequences of sets"" show complex repetition behavior, sometimes repeating prior sets wholesale, and sometimes creating new sets from partial copies or partial merges of earlier sets. In this paper, we provide a stochastic model to capture these patterns. The model has two classes of parameters. First, a correlation parameter determines how much of an earlier set will contribute to a future set. Second, a vector of recency parameters captures the fact that a set in a sequence is more similar to recent sets than more distant ones. Comparing against a strong baseline, we find that modeling both correlation and recency structures are required for high accuracy. We also find that both parameter classes vary widely across domains, so must be optimized on a per-dataset basis. We present the model in detail, provide a theoretical examination of its asymptotic behavior, and perform a set of detailed experiments on its predictive performance."
Deep Adversarial Learning for Multi-Modality Missing Data Completion,"Multi-modality data are widely used in clinical applications, such as tumor detection and brain disease diagnosis. Different modalities can usually provide complementary information, which commonly leads to improved performance. However, some modalities are commonly missing for some subjects due to various technical and practical reasons. As a result, multi-modality data are usually incomplete, raising the multi-modality missing data completion problem. In this work, we formulate the problem as a conditional image generation task and propose an encoder-decoder deep neural network to tackle this problem. Specifically, the model takes the existing modality as input and generates the missing modality. By employing an auxiliary adversarial loss, our model is able to generate high-quality missing modality images. At the same time, we propose to incorporate the available category information of subjects in training to enable the model to generate more informative images. We evaluate our method on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative~(ADNI) database, where positron emission tomography~(PET) modalities are missing. Experimental results show that the trained network can generate high-quality PET modalities based on existing magnetic resonance imaging~(MRI) modalities, and provide complementary information to improve the detection and tracking of the Alzheimer's disease. Our results also show that the proposed methods generate higher quality images than baseline methods as measured by various image quality statistics."
Network Connectivity Optimization: Fundamental Limits and Effective Algorithms,"Network connectivity optimization, which aims to manipulate network connectivity by changing its underlying topology, is a fundamental task behind a wealth of high-impact data mining applications, ranging from immunization, critical infrastructure construction, social collaboration mining, bioinformatics analysis, to intelligent transportation system design. To tackle its exponential computation complexity, greedy algorithms have been extensively used for network connectivity optimization by exploiting its diminishing returns property. Despite the empirical success, two key challenges largely remain open. First, on the theoretic side, the hardness, as well as the approximability of the general network connectivity optimization problem are still nascent except for a few special instances. Second, on the algorithmic side, current algorithms are often hard to balance between the optimization quality and the computational efficiency. In this paper, we systematically address these two challenges for the network connectivity optimization problem. First, we reveal some fundamental limits by proving that, for a wide range of network connectivity optimization problems, (1) they are NP-hard and (2) (1-1/e) is the optimal approximation ratio for any polynomial algorithms. Second, we propose an effective, scalable and general algorithm (CONTAIN) to carefully balance the optimization quality and the computational efficiency."
PME: Projected Metric Embedding on Heterogeneous Networks for Link Prediction,"Heterogenous information network embedding aims to embed heterogenous information networks (HINs) into low dimensional spaces, in which each vertex is represented as a low-dimensional vector, and both global and local network structures in the original space are preserved. However, most of existing heterogenous information network embedding models adopt the dot product to measure the proximity in the low dimensional space, and thus they can only preserve the first-order proximity and are insufficient to capture the global structure. Compared with homogenous information networks, there are multiple types of links (i.e., multiple relations) in HINs, and the link distribution w.r.t relations is highly skewed. To address the above challenging issues, we propose a novel heterogenous information network embedding model PME based on the metric learning to capture both first-order and second-order proximities in a unified way. To alleviate the potential geometrical inflexibility of existing metric learning approaches, we propose to build object and relation embeddings in separate object space and relation spaces rather than in a common space. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by firstly projecting vertices from object space to corresponding relation space and then calculate the proximity between projected vertices. To overcome the heavy skewness of the link distribution w.r.t relations and avoid ""over-sampling'' or ""under-sampling'' for each relation, we propose a novel loss-aware adaptive sampling approach for the model optimization. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale HIN dataset, and the experimental results show superiority of our proposed PME model in terms of prediction accuracy and scalability."
Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Environment with Application to Online Recommendation,"Deep reinforcement learning has shown great potential in improving system performance autonomously, by learning from iterations with the environment. However, traditional reinforcement learning approaches are designed to work in static environments. In many real-world problems, the environments are commonly dynamic, in which the performance of reinforcement learning approaches can degrade drastically. A direct cause of the performance degradation is the high-variance and biased estimation of the reward, due to the distribution shifting in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose two techniques to alleviate the unstable reward estimation problem in dynamic environments, the stratified sampling replay strategy and the approximate regretted reward, which address the problem from the sample aspect and the reward aspect, respectively. Integrating the two techniques with Double DQN, we propose the Robust DQN method. We apply Robust DQN in the tip recommendation system in Taobao online retail trading platform. We firstly disclose the highly dynamic property of the recommendation application. We then carried out online A/B test to examine Robust DQN. The results show that Robust DQN can effectively stabilize the value estimation and, therefore, improves the performance in this real-world dynamic environment."
Quantifying and Minimizing Risk of Conflict in Social Networks,"Controversy, disagreement, conflict, polarization and opinion divergence in social networks have been the subject of much recent research. In particular, researchers have addressed the question of how such concepts can be quantified given people's prior opinions, and how they can be optimized by influencing the opinion of a small number of people or by editing the network's connectivity.Here, rather than optimizing such concepts given a specific set of prior opinions, we study whether they can be optimized in the average case and in the worst case over all sets of prior opinions. In particular, we derive the worst-case and average-case conflict risk of networks, and we propose algorithms for optimizing these. For some measures of conflict, these are non-convex optimization problems with many local minima. We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of the nature of some of these local minima, and show how they are related to existing organizational structures.Empirical results show how a small number of edits quickly decreases its conflict risk, both average-case and worst-case. Furthermore, it shows that minimizing average-case conflict risk often does not reduce worst-case conflict risk. Minimizing worst-case conflict risk on the other hand, while computationally more challenging, is generally effective at minimizing both worst-case as well as average-case conflict risk."
Spectral Clustering of Large-scale Data by Directly Solving Normalized Cut,"During the past decades, many spectral clustering algorithms have been proposed. However, their high computational complexities hinder their applications on large-scale data. Moreover, most of them use a two-step approach to obtain the optimal solution, which may deviate from the solution by directly solving the original problem. In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm, namely Direct Normalized Cut (DNC), to directly optimize the normalized cut model. DNC has a quadratic time complexity, which is a significant reduction comparing with the cubic time complexity of the traditional spectral clustering. To cope with large-scale data, a Fast Normalized Cut (FNC) method with linear time and space complexities is proposed by extending DNC with an anchor-based strategy. In the new method, we first seek a set of anchors and then construct a representative similarity matrix by computing distances between the anchors and the whole data set. To find high quality anchors that best represent the whole data set, we propose a Balanced k-means (BKM) to partition a data set into balanced clusters and use the cluster centers as anchors. Then DNC is used to obtain the final clustering result from the representative similarity matrix. A series of experiments were conducted on both synthetic data and real-world data sets, and the experimental results show the superior performance of BKM, DNC and FNC."
Learning-to-Ask: Knowledge Acquisition via 20 Questions,"Almost all the knowledge empowered applications rely upon accurate knowledge, which has to be either collected manually with high cost, or extracted automatically with unignorable errors. In this paper, we study 20 Questions, an online interactive game where each question-response pair corresponds to a fact of the target entity, to acquire highly accurate knowledge effectively with nearly zero labor cost. Knowledge acquisition via 20 Questions predominantly presents two challenges to the intelligent agent playing games with human players. The first one is to seek enough information and identify the target entity with as few questions as possible, while the second one is to leverage the remaining questioning opportunities to acquire valuable knowledge effectively, both of which count on good questioning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose the Learning-to-Ask (LA) framework, within which the agent learns smart questioning strategies for information seeking and knowledge acquisition by means of deep reinforcement learning and generalized matrix factorization respectively. In addition, a Bayesian approach to represent knowledge is adopted to ensure robustness to noisy user responses. Simulating experiments on real data show that LA is able to equip the agent with effective questioning strategies, which result in high winning rates and rapid knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the questioning strategies for information seeking and knowledge acquisition boost the performance of each other, allowing the agent to start with a relatively small knowledge set and quickly improve its knowledge base in the absence of constant human supervision."
Voxel Deconvolutional Networks for 3D Brain Image Labeling,"Deep learning methods have shown great success in pixel-wise prediction tasks. One of the most popular methods employs an encoder-decoder network in which deconvolutional layers are used for up-sampling feature maps. However, a key limitation of the deconvolutional layer is that it suffers from the checkerboard artifact problem, which harms the prediction accuracy. This is caused by the independency among adjacent pixels on the output feature maps. Previous work only solved the checkerboard artifact issue of deconvolutional layers in the 2D space. Since the number of intermediate feature maps needed to generate a deconvolutional layer grows exponentially with dimensionality, it is more challenging to solve this issue in higher dimensions. In this work, we propose the voxel deconvolutional layer (VoxelDCL) to solve the checkerboard artifact problem of deconvolutional layers in 3D space. We also provide an efficient approach to implement VoxelDCL. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelDCL, we build four variations of voxel deconvolutional networks (VoxelDCN) based on the U-Net architecture with VoxelDCL. We apply our networks to address volumetric brain images labeling tasks using the ADNI and LONI LPBA40 datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed iVoxelDCNa achieves improved performance in all experiments. It reaches 83.34% in terms of dice ratio on the ADNI dataset and 79.12% on the LONI LPBA40 dataset, which increases 1.39% and 2.21% respectively compared with the baseline. In addition, all the variations of VoxelDCN we proposed outperform the baseline methods on the above datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods."
Local Latent Space Models for Top-N Recommendation,"Users' behaviors are driven by their preferences across various aspects of items they are potentially interested in purchasing, viewing, etc. Latent space approaches model these aspects in the form of latent factors. Although such approaches have been shown to lead to good results, the aspects that are important to different users can vary. In many domains, there may be a set of aspects for which all users care about and a set of aspects that are specific to different subsets of users. To explicitly capture this, we consider models in which there are some latent factors that capture the shared aspects and some user subset specific latent factors that capture the set of aspects that the different subsets of users care about.In particular, we propose two latent space models: rGLSVD and sGLSVD, that combine such a global and user subset specific sets of latent factors. The rGLSVD model assigns the users into different subsets based on their rating patterns and then estimates a global and a set of user subset specific local models whose number of latent dimensions can vary.The sGLSVD model estimates both global and user subset specific local models by keeping the number of latent dimensions the same among these models but optimizes the grouping of the users in order to achieve the best approximation. Our experiments on various real-world datasets show that the proposed approaches significantly outperform state-of-the-art latent space top-N recommendation approaches."
Exact and Consistent Interpretation for Piecewise Linear Neural Networks: A Closed Form Solution,"Strong intelligent machines powered by deep neural networks are increasingly deployed as black boxes to make decisions in risk-sensitive domains, such as finance and medical. To reduce potential risk and build trust with users, it is critical to interpret how such machines make their decisions. Existing works interpret a pre-trained neural network by analyzing hidden neurons, mimicking pre-trained models or approximating local predictions. However, these methods do not provide a guarantee on the exactness and consistency of their interpretations. In this paper, we propose an elegant closed form solution named $OpenBox$ to compute exact and consistent interpretations for the family of Piecewise Linear Neural Networks (PLNN). The major idea is to first transform a PLNN into a mathematically equivalent set of linear classifiers, then interpret each linear classifier by the features that dominate its prediction. We further apply $OpenBox$ to demonstrate the effectiveness of non-negative and sparse constraints on improving the interpretability of PLNNs. The extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets clearly demonstrate the exactness and consistency of our interpretation."
Identifying Sources and Sinks in the Presence of Multiple Agents with Gaussian Process Vector Calculus,"In systems of multiple agents, identifying the cause of observed agent dynamics is challenging. Often, these agents operate in diverse, non-stationary environments, where models rely on hand-crafted environment-specific features to infer influential regions in the system's surroundings. To overcome the limitations of these inflexible models, we present GP-LAPLACE, a technique for locating sources and sinks from trajectories in time-varying fields. Using Gaussian processes, we jointly infer a spatio-temporal vector field, as well as canonical vector calculus operations on that field. Notably, we do this from only agent trajectories without requiring knowledge of the environment, and also obtain a metric for denoting the significance of inferred causal features in the environment by exploiting our probabilistic method. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to both synthetic and real-world GPS data, demonstrating the applicability of our technique in the presence of multiple agents, as well as its superiority over existing methods."
Approximating the Spectrum of a Graph,"The spectrum of a network or graph $G=(V,E)$ with adjacency matrix A , consists of the eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian $L= I - D^-1/2 A D^-1/2 $. This set of eigenvalues encapsulates many aspects of the structure of the graph, including the extent to which the graph posses community structures at multiple scales. We study the problem of approximating the spectrum, $łambda = (łambda_1,\dots,łambda_|V| )$, of G in the regime where the graph is too large to explicitly calculate the spectrum. We present a sublinear time algorithm that, given the ability to query a random node in the graph and select a random neighbor of a given node, computes a succinct representation of an approximation $\widetilde łambda = (\widetilde łambda_1,\dots,\widetilde łambda_|V| )$, such that $\|\widetilde łambda - łambda\|_1 łe ε |V|$. Our algorithm has query complexity and running time $exp(O(1/\eps))$, which is independent of the size of the graph, $|V|$. We demonstrate the practical viability of our algorithm on synthetically generated graphs, and on 15 different real-world graphs from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection, including social networks, academic collaboration graphs, and road networks. For the smallest of these graphs, we are able to validate the accuracy of our algorithm by explicitly calculating the true spectrum; for the larger graphs, such a calculation is computationally prohibitive. The spectra of these real-world networks reveal insights into the structural similarities and differences between them, illustrating the potential value of our algorithm for efficiently approximating the spectrum of large large networks."
D2K: Scalable Community Detection in Massive Networks via Small-Diameter k-Plexes,"This paper studies k-plexes, a well known pseudo-clique model for network communities. In a k-plex, each node can miss at most k-1 links. Our goal is to detect large communities in today's real-world graphs which can have hundreds of millions of edges. While many have tried, this task has been elusive so far due to its computationally challenging nature: k-plexes and other pseudo-cliques are harder to find and more numerous than cliques, a well known hard problem. We present D2K, which is the first algorithm able to find large k-plexes of very large graphs in just a few minutes. The good performance of our algorithm follows from a combination of graph-theoretical concepts, careful algorithm engineering and a high-performance implementation. In particular, we exploit the low degeneracy of real-world graphs, and the fact that large enough k-plexes have diameter 2. We validate a sequential and a parallel/distributed implementation of D2K on real graphs with up to half a billion edges."
Node Similarity with q -Grams for Real-World Labeled Networks,"We study node similarity in labeled networks, using the label sequences found in paths of bounded length q leading to the nodes. (This recalls the q-grams employed in document resemblance, based on the Jaccard distance.) When applied to networks, the challenge is two-fold: the number of q-grams generated from labeled paths grows exponentially with q, and their frequency should be taken into account: this leads to a variation of the Jaccard index known as Bray-Curtis index for multisets. We describe nSimGram, a suite of fast algorithms for node similarity with q-grams, based on a novel blend of color coding, probabilistic counting, sketches, and string algorithms, where the universe of elements to sample is exponential. We provide experimental evidence that our measure is effective and our running times scale to deal with large real-world networks."
An Empirical Evaluation of Sketching for Numerical Linear Algebra,"Over the last ten years, tremendous speedups for problems in randomized numerical linear algebra such as low rank approximation and regression have been made possible via the technique of randomized data dimensionality reduction, also known as sketching. In theory, such algorithms have led to optimal input sparsity time algorithms for a wide array of problems. While several scattered implementations of such methods exist, the goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive comparison of such methods to alternative approaches. We investigate least squares regression, iteratively reweighted least squares, logistic regression, robust regression with Huber and Bisquare loss functions, leverage score computation, Frobenius norm low rank approximation, and entrywise $\ell_1$-low rank approximation. We give various implementation techniques to speed up several of these algorithms, and the resulting implementations demonstrate the tradeoffs of such techniques in practice."
Transfer Learning via Feature Isomorphism Discovery,"Transfer learning has gained increasing attention due to the inferior performance of machine learning algorithms with insufficient training data. Most of the previous homogeneous or heterogeneous transfer learning works aim to learn a mapping function between feature spaces based on the inherent correspondence across the source and target domains or labeled instances. However, in many real world applications, existing methods may not be robust when the correspondence across domains is noisy or labeled instances are not representative. In this paper, we develop a novel transfer learning framework called Transfer Learning via Feature Isomorphism Discovery (abbreviated to TLFid), which owns high tolerance for noisy correspondence between domains as well as scarce or non-existing labeled instances. More specifically, we propose a feature isomorphism approach to discovering common substructures across feature spaces and learning a feature mapping function from the target domain to the source domain. We evaluate the performance of TLFid on the cross-lingual sentiment classification tasks. The results show that our method achieves significant improvement in terms of accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
Investor-Imitator: A Framework for Trading Knowledge Extraction,"Stock trading is a popular investment approach in real world. However, since lacking enough domain knowledge and experience, it is very difficult for common investors to analyze thousands of stocks manually. Algorithmic investment provides another rational way to formulate human knowledge as a trading agent. However, it still requires well-built knowledge and experience to design effective trading algorithms in such a volatile market. Fortunately, various kinds of historical trading records are easy to obtain in this big-data era, it is invaluable of us to extract the trading knowledge hidden in the data to help people make better decisions. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning driven Investor-Imitator framework to formalize the trading knowledge, by imitating an investor's behavior with a set of logic descriptors. In particular, to instantiate specific logic descriptors, we introduce the Rank-Invest model that can keep the diversity of logic descriptors by learning to optimize different evaluation metrics. In the experiment, we first simulate three types of investors, representing different degrees of information disclosure we may meet in real market. By learning towards these investors, we can tell the inherent trading logic of the target investor with the Investor-Imitator empirically, and the extracted interpretable knowledge can help us better understand and construct trading portfolios. Experimental results in this paper sufficiently demonstrate the designed purpose of Investor-Imitator, it makes the Investor-Imitator an applicable and meaningful intelligent trading framework in financial investment research."
Learning Structural Node Embeddings via Diffusion Wavelets,"Nodes residing in different parts of a graph can have similar structural roles within their local network topology. The identification of such roles provides key insight into the organization of networks and can be used for a variety of machine learning tasks. However, learning structural representations of nodes is a challenging problem, and it has typically involved manually specifying and tailoring topological features for each node. In this paper, we develop GraphWave, a method that represents each node's network neighborhood via a low-dimensional embedding by leveraging heat wavelet diffusion patterns. Instead of training on hand-selected features, GraphWave learns these embeddings in an unsupervised way. We mathematically prove that nodes with similar network neighborhoods will have similar GraphWave embeddings even though these nodes may reside in very different parts of the network, and our method scales linearly with the number of edges. Experiments in a variety of different settings demonstrate GraphWave's real-world potential for capturing structural roles in networks, and our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in every experiment, by as much as 137%."
Demand-Aware Charger Planning for Electric Vehicle Sharing,"Cars of the future have been predicted as shared and electric. There has been a rapid growth in electric vehicle (EV) sharing services worldwide in recent years. For EV-sharing platforms to excel, it is essential for them to offer private charging infrastructure for exclusive use that meets the charging demand of their clients. Particularly, they need to plan not only the places to build charging stations, but also the amounts of chargers per station, to maximally satisfy the requirements on global charging coverage and local charging demand. Existing research efforts are either inapplicable for their different problem formulations or are at a coarse granularity. In this paper, we formulate the \underlineE lectric \underlineV ehicle \underlineC harger \underlineP lanning (EVCP) problem especially for EV-sharing. We prove that the \shortpro problem is NP-hard, and design an approximation algorithm to solve the problem with a theoretical bound of $1-\frac1 e $. We also devise some optimization techniques to speed up the solution. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our proposed solutions."
FASTEN: Fast Sylvester Equation Solver for Graph Mining,"The Sylvester equation offers a powerful and unifying primitive for a variety of important graph mining tasks, including network alignment, graph kernel, node similarity, subgraph matching, etc. A major bottleneck of Sylvester equation lies in its high computational complexity. Despite tremendous effort, state-of-the-art methods still require a complexity that is at least \em quadratic in the number of nodes of graphs, even with approximations. In this paper, we propose a family of Krylov subspace based algorithms (\fasten) to speed up and scale up the computation of Sylvester equation for graph mining. The key idea of the proposed methods is to project the original equivalent linear system onto a Kronecker Krylov subspace. We further exploit (1) the implicit representation of the solution matrix as well as the associated computation, and (2) the decomposition of the original Sylvester equation into a set of inter-correlated Sylvester equations of smaller size. The proposed algorithms bear two distinctive features. First, they provide the \em exact solutions without any approximation error. Second, they significantly reduce the time and space complexity for solving Sylvester equation, with two of the proposed algorithms having a \em linear complexity in both time and space. Experimental evaluations on a diverse set of real networks, demonstrate that our methods (1) are up to $10,000\times$ faster against Conjugate Gradient method, the best known competitor that outputs the exact solution, and (2) scale up to million-node graphs."
Multi-view Adversarially Learned Inference for Cross-domain Joint Distribution Matching,"Many important data mining problems can be modeled as learning a (bidirectional) multidimensional mapping between two data domains. Based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs), particularly conditional ones, cross-domain joint distribution matching is an increasingly popular kind of methods addressing such problems. Though significant advances have been achieved, there are still two main disadvantages of existing models, i.e., the requirement of large amount of paired training samples and the notorious instability of training. In this paper, we propose a multi-view adversarially learned inference (ALI) model, termed as MALI, to address these issues. Unlike the common practice of learning direct domain mappings, our model relies on shared latent representations of both domains and can generate arbitrary number of paired faking samples, benefiting from which usually very few paired samples (together with sufficient unpaired ones) is enough for learning good mappings. Extending the vanilla ALI model, we design novel discriminators to judge the quality of generated samples (both paired and unpaired), and provide theoretical analysis of our new formulation. Experiments on image-to-image translation, image-to-attribute generation (multi-label classification), attribute-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that our semi-supervised learning framework yields significant performance improvements over existing ones. Results on cross-modality retrieval show that our latent space based method can achieve competitive similarity search performance in relative fast speed, compared to those methods that compute similarities in the high-dimensional data space."
Towards Explanation of DNN-based Prediction with Guided Feature Inversion,"While deep neural networks (DNN) have become an effective computational tool, the prediction results are often criticized by the lack of interpretability, which is essential in many real-world applications such as health informatics. Existing attempts based on local interpretations aim to identify relevant features contributing the most to the prediction of DNN by monitoring the neighborhood of a given input. They usually simply ignore the intermediate layers of the DNN that might contain rich information for interpretation. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose to investigate a guided feature inversion framework for taking advantage of the deep architectures towards effective interpretation. The proposed framework not only determines the contribution of each feature in the input but also provides insights into the decision-making process of DNN models. By further interacting with the neuron of the target category at the output layer of the DNN, we enforce the interpretation result to be class-discriminative. We apply the proposed interpretation model to different CNN architectures to provide explanations for image data and conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and PASCAL VOC07 datasets. The interpretation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in providing class-discriminative interpretation for DNN-based prediction."
BagMinHash - Minwise Hashing Algorithm for Weighted Sets,"Minwise hashing has become a standard tool to calculate signatures which allow direct estimation of Jaccard similarities. While very efficient algorithms already exist for the unweighted case, the calculation of signatures for weighted sets is still a time consuming task. BagMinHash is a new algorithm that can be orders of magnitude faster than current state of the art without any particular restrictions or assumptions on weights or data dimensionality. Applied to the special case of unweighted sets, it represents the first efficient algorithm producing independent signature components. A series of tests finally verifies the new algorithm and also reveals limitations of other approaches published in the recent past."
SpotLight: Detecting Anomalies in Streaming Graphs,"How do we spot interesting events from e-mail or transportation logs? How can we detect port scan or denial of service attacks from IP-IP communication data? In general, given a sequence of weighted, directed or bipartite graphs, each summarizing a snapshot of activity in a time window, how can we spot anomalous graphs containing the sudden appearance or disappearance of large dense subgraphs (e.g., near bicliques) in near real-time using sublinear memory? To this end, we propose a randomized sketching-based approach called SpotLight, which guarantees that an anomalous graph is mapped 'far' away from 'normal' instances in the sketch space with high probability for appropriate choice of parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that SpotLight (a) improves accuracy by at least 8.4% compared to prior approaches, (b) is fast and can process millions of edges within a few minutes, (c) scales linearly with the number of edges and sketching dimensions and (d) leads to interesting discoveries in practice."
Deep Multi-Output Forecasting: Learning to Accurately Predict Blood Glucose Trajectories,"In many forecasting applications, it is valuable to predict not only the value of a signal at a certain time point in the future, but also the values leading up to that point. This is especially true in clinical applications, where the future state of the patient can be less important than the patient's overall trajectory. This requires multi-step forecasting, a forecasting variant where one aims to predict multiple values in the future simultaneously. Standard methods to accomplish this can propagate error from prediction to prediction, reducing quality over the long term. In light of these challenges, we propose multi-output deep architectures for multi-step forecasting in which we explicitly model the distribution of future values of the signal over a prediction horizon. We apply these techniques to the challenging and clinically relevant task of blood glucose forecasting. Through a series of experiments on a real-world dataset consisting of 550K blood glucose measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in capturing the underlying signal dynamics. Compared to existing shallow and deep methods, we find that our proposed approaches improve performance individually and capture complementary information, leading to a large improvement over the baseline when combined (4.87 vs. 5.31 absolute percentage error (APE)). Overall, the results suggest the efficacy of our proposed approach in predicting blood glucose level and multi-step forecasting more generally."
Scalable Active Learning by Approximated Error Reduction,"We study the problem of active learning for multi-class classification on large-scale datasets. In this setting, the existing active learning approaches built upon uncertainty measures are ineffective for discovering unknown regions, and those based on expected error reduction are inefficient owing to their huge time costs. To overcome the above issues, this paper proposes a novel query selection criterion called approximated error reduction (AER). In AER, the error reduction of each candidate is estimated based on an expected impact over all datapoints and an approximated ratio between the error reduction and the impact over its nearby datapoints. In particular, we utilize hierarchical anchor graphs to construct the candidate set as well as the nearby datapoint sets of these candidates. The benefit of this strategy is that it enables a hierarchical expansion of candidates with the increase of labels, and allows us to further accelerate the AER estimation. We finally introduce AER into an efficient semi-supervised classifier for scalable active learning. Experiments on publicly available datasets with the sizes varying from thousands to millions demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Self-Paced Network Embedding,"Network embedding has attracted increasing attention in recent data mining research with many real-world applications. Network embedding is to learn low-dimensional representations for nodes in a network. A popular kind of existing methods, such as DeepWalk, Node2Vec, and LINE, learn node representations by pushing positive context node to the anchor node while pushing negative context nodes away from it in the low-dimensional vector space. When sampling the negative context nodes, they usually employ a predefined sampling distribution based on the node popularity. However, this sampling distribution often fails to capture the real informativeness of each node and cannot reflect the training state. To address these important problems, in this paper, we propose a novel self-paced network embedding method. Specifically, our method can adaptively capture the informativeness of each node based on the current training state, and sample negative context nodes in terms of their informativeness. The proposed self-paced sampling strategy can gradually select difficult negative context nodes with training process going on to learn better node representations. Moreover, to better capture the node informativeness for learning node representations, we extend our method to the generative adversarial network framework, which has the larger capacity to discover node informativeness. The extensive experiments have been conducted on the benchmark network datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods."
Large-Scale Learnable Graph Convolutional Networks,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success on grid-like data such as images, but face tremendous challenges in learning from more generic data such as graphs. In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic graphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here, we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional layer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes for each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into grid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular convolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on large-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the excessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior methods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our methods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets. Our results also indicate that the proposed methods using sub-graph training strategy are more efficient as compared to prior approaches."
Route Recommendations for Idle Taxi Drivers: Find Me the Shortest Route to a Customer!,"We study the problem of route recommendation to idle taxi drivers such that the distance between the taxi and an anticipated customer request is minimized. Minimizing the distance to the next anticipated customer leads to more productivity for the taxi driver and less waiting time for the customer. To anticipate when and where future customer requests are likely to come from and accordingly recom- mend routes, we develop a route recommendation engine called MDM: Minimizing Distance through Monte Carlo Tree Search. In contrast to existing techniques, MDM employs a continuous learning platform where the underlying model to predict future customer requests is dynamically updated. Extensive experiments on real taxi data from New York and San Francisco reveal that MDM is up to 70% better than the state of the art and robust to anomalous events such as concerts, sporting events, etc."
Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Network for Gene Expression Inference,"Gene expression profiling provides comprehensive characterization of cellular states under different experimental conditions, thus contributes to the prosperity of many fields of biomedical research. Although the rapid development of gene expression profiling has been observed, genome-wide profiling of large libraries is still expensive and difficult. Due to the fact that there are significant correlations between gene expression patterns, previous studies introduced regression models for predicting the target gene expressions from the landmark gene profiles. These models formulate the gene expression inference in a completely supervised manner, which require a large labeled dataset (i.e. paired landmark and target gene expressions). However, collecting the whole gene expressions is much more expensive than the landmark genes. In order to address this issue and take advantage of cheap unlabeled data (i.e. landmark genes), we propose a novel semi-supervised deep generative model for target gene expression inference. Our model is based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) to approximate the joint distribution of landmark and target genes, and an inference network to learn the conditional distribution of target genes given the landmark genes. We employ the reliable generated data by our GAN model as the extra training pairs to improve the training of our inference model, and utilize the trustworthy predictions of the inference network to enhance the adversarial training of our GAN network. We evaluate our model on the prediction of two types of gene expression data and identify obvious advantage over the counterparts."
Training Big Random Forests with Little Resources,"Without access to large compute clusters, building random forests on large datasets is still a challenging problem. This is, in particular, the case if fully-grown trees are desired. We propose a simple yet effective framework that allows to efficiently construct ensembles of huge trees for hundreds of millions or even billions of training instances using a cheap desktop computer with commodity hardware. The basic idea is to consider a multi-level construction scheme, which builds top trees for small random subsets of the available data and which subsequently distributes all training instances to the top trees' leaves for further processing. While being conceptually simple, the overall efficiency crucially depends on the particular implementation of the different phases. The practical merits of our approach are demonstrated using dense datasets with hundreds of millions of training instances."
When Sentiment Analysis Meets Social Network: A Holistic User Behavior Modeling in Opinionated Data,"User modeling is critical for understanding user intents, while it is also challenging as user intents are so diverse and not directly observable. Most existing works exploit specific types of behavior signals for user modeling, e.g., opinionated data or network structure; but the dependency among different types of user-generated data is neglected.We focus on self-consistence across multiple modalities of user-generated data to model user intents. A probabilistic generative model is developed to integrate two companion learning tasks of opinionated content modeling and social network structure modeling for users. Individual users are modeled as a mixture over the instances of paired learning tasks to realize their behavior heterogeneity, and the tasks are clustered by sharing a global prior distribution to capture the homogeneity among users. Extensive experimental evaluations on large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews with social network structures confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The learned user models are interpretable and predictive: they enable more accurate sentiment classification and item/friend recommendations than the corresponding baselines that only model a singular type of user behaviors."
LARC: Learning Activity-Regularized Overlapping Communities Across Time,"Communities are essential building blocks of complex networks enjoying significant research attention in terms of modeling and detection algorithms. Common across models is the premise that node pairs that share communities are likely to interact more strongly. Moreover, in the most general setting a node may be a member of multiple communities, and thus, interact with more than one cohesive group of other nodes. If node interactions are observed over a long period and aggregated into a single static network, the communities may be hard to discern due to their in-network overlap. Alternatively, if interactions are observed over short time periods, the communities may be only partially observable. How can we detect communities at an appropriate temporal resolution that resonates with their natural periods of activity? We propose LARC, a general framework for joint learning of the overlapping community structure and the periods of activity of communities, directly from temporal interaction data. We formulate the problem as an optimization task coupling community fit and smooth temporal activation over time. To the best of our knowledge, the tensor version of LARC is the first tensor-based community detection method to introduce such smoothness constraints. We propose efficient algorithms for the problem, achieving a $2.6x$ quality improvement over all baselines for high temporal resolution datasets, and consistently detecting better-quality communities for different levels of data aggregation and varying community overlap. In addition, LARC elucidates interpretable temporal patterns of community activity corresponding to botnet attacks, transportation change points and public forum interaction trends, while being computationally practical---few minutes on large real datasets. Finally, LARC provides a comprehensive \em unsupervised parameter estimation methodology yielding high accuracy and rendering it easy-to-use for practitioners."
New Incremental Learning Algorithm for Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine,"Semi-supervised learning is especially important in data mining applications because it can make use of plentiful unlabeled data to train the high-quality learning models. Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine (S3VM) is a powerful semi-supervised learning model. However, the high computational cost and non-convexity severely impede the S3VM method in large-scale applications. Although several learning algorithms were proposed for S3VM, scaling up S3VM is still an open problem. To address this challenging problem, in this paper, we propose a new incremental learning algorithm to scale up S3VM (IL-S3VM) based on the path following technique in the framework of Difference of Convex (DC) programming. The traditional DC programming based algorithms need multiple outer loops and are not suitable for incremental learning, and traditional path following algorithms are limited to convex problems. Our new IL-S3VM algorithm based on the path-following technique can directly update the solution of S3VM to converge to a local minimum within one outer loop so that the efficient incremental learning can be achieved. More importantly, we provide the finite convergence analysis for our new algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, our new IL-S3VM algorithm is the first efficient path following algorithm for a non-convex problem (i.e., S3VM) with local minimum convergence guarantee. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark datasets not only confirm the finite convergence of IL-S3VM, but also show a huge reduction of computational time compared with existing batch and incremental learning algorithms, while retaining the similar generalization performance."
R 2 SDH: Robust Rotated Supervised Discrete Hashing,"Learning-based hashing has recently received considerable attentions due to its capability of supporting efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional data such as images, videos, and documents. In this paper, we propose a learning-based hashing algorithm called ""Robust Rotated Supervised Discrete Hashing"" (R 2 SDH), by extending the previous work on ""Supervised Discrete Hashing"" (SDH). In R 2 SDH, correntropy is adopted to replace the least square regression (LSR) model in SDH for achieving better robustness. Furthermore, considering the commonly used distance metrics such as cosine and Euclidean distance are invariant to rotational transformation, rotation is integrated into the original zero-one label matrix used in SDH, as additional freedom to promote flexibility without sacrificing accuracy. The rotation matrix is learned through an optimization procedure. Experimental results on three image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and NUS-WIDE) confirm that R 2 SDH generally outperforms SDH."
Multi-label Learning with Highly Incomplete Data via Collaborative Embedding,"Tremendous efforts have been dedicated to improving the effectiveness of multi-label learning with incomplete label assignments. Most of the current techniques assume that the input features of data instances are complete. Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of highly incomplete features and weak label assignments is a challenging and widely perceived issue in real-world multi-label learning applications due to a number of practical reasons including incomplete data collection, moderate labels from annotators, etc. Existing multi-label learning algorithms are not directly applicable when the observed features are highly incomplete. In this work, we attack this problem by proposing a weakly supervised multi-label learning approach, based on the idea of collaborative embedding. This approach provides a flexible framework to conduct efficient multi-label classification at both transductive and inductive mode by coupling the process of reconstructing missing features and weak label assignments in a joint optimisation framework. It is designed to collaboratively recover feature and label information, and extract the predictive association between the feature profile and the multi-label tag of the same data instance. Substantial experiments on public benchmark datasets and real security event data validate that our proposed method can provide distinctively more accurate transductive and inductive classification than other state-of-the-art algorithms."
PCA by Determinant Optimisation has no Spurious Local Optima,"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) finds the best linear representation for data and is an indispensable tool in many learning tasks. Classically, principal components of a dataset are interpreted as the directions that preserve most of its ""energy"", an interpretation that is theoretically underpinned by the celebrated Eckart-Young-Mirsky Theorem. There are yet other ways of interpreting PCA that are rarely exploited in practice, largely because it is not known how to reliably solve the corresponding non-convex optimisation programs. In this paper, we consider one such interpretation of principal components as the directions that preserve most of the ""volume"" of the dataset. Our main contribution is a theorem that shows that the corresponding non-convex program has no spurious local optima, and is therefore amenable to many convex solvers. We also confirm our findings numerically."
Automated Local Regression Discontinuity Design Discovery,"Inferring causal relationships in observational data is crucial for understanding scientific and social processes. We develop the first statistical machine learning approach for automatically discovering regression discontinuity designs (RDDs), a quasi-experimental setup often used in econometrics. Our method identifies interpretable, localized RDDs in arbitrary dimensional data and can seamlessly compute treatment effects without expert supervision. By applying the technique to a variety of synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate robust performance under adverse conditions including unobserved variables, substantial noise, and model"
Disturbance Grassmann Kernels for Subspace-Based Learning,"In this paper, we focus on subspace-based learning problems, where data elements are linear subspaces instead of vectors. To handle this kind of data, Grassmann kernels were proposed to measure the space structure and used with classifiers, e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVMs). However, the existing discriminative algorithms mostly ignore the instability of subspaces, which would cause the classifiers to be misled by disturbed instances. Thus we propose considering all potential disturbances of subspaces in learning processes to obtain more robust classifiers. Firstly, we derive the dual optimization of linear classifiers with disturbances subject to a known distribution, resulting in a new kernel, Disturbance Grassmann (DG) kernel. Secondly, we research into two kinds of disturbance, relevant to the subspace matrix and singular values of bases, with which we extend the Projection kernel on Grassmann manifolds to two new kernels. Experiments on action data indicate that the proposed kernels perform better compared to state-of-the-art subspace-based methods, even in a worse environment."
Leveraging Meta-path based Context for Top- N Recommendation with A Neural Co-Attention Model,"Heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been widely adopted in recommender systems due to its excellence in modeling complex context information. Although existing HIN based recommendation methods have achieved performance improvement to some extent, they have two major shortcomings. First, these models seldom learn an explicit representation for path or meta-path in the recommendation task. Second, they do not consider the mutual effect between the meta-path and the involved user-item pair in an interaction. To address these issues, we develop a novel deep neural network with the co-attention mechanism for leveraging rich meta-path based context for top-N recommendation. We elaborately design a three-way neural interaction model by explicitly incorporating meta-path based context. To construct the meta-path based context, we propose to use a priority based sampling technique to select high-quality path instances. Our model is able to learn effective representations for users, items and meta-path based context for implementing a powerful interaction function. The co-attention mechanism improves the representations for meta-path based con- text, users and items in a mutual enhancement way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. In particular, the proposed model performs well in the cold-start scenario and has potentially good interpretability for the recommendation results."
Metric Learning from Probabilistic Labels,"Metric learning aims to learn a good distance metric that can capture the relationships among instances, and its importance has long been recognized in many fields. In the traditional settings of metric learning, an implicit assumption is that the associated labels of the instances are deterministic. However, in many real-world applications, the associated labels come naturally with probabilities instead of deterministic values. Thus, the existing metric learning methods cannot work well in these applications. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we study how to effectively learn the distance metric from datasets that contain probabilistic information, and then propose two novel metric learning mechanisms for two types of probabilistic labels, i.e., the instance-wise probabilistic label and the group-wise probabilistic label. Compared with the existing metric learning methods, our proposed mechanisms are capable of learning distance metrics directly from the probabilistic labels with high accuracy. We also theoretically analyze the two proposed mechanisms and provide theoretical bounds on the sample complexity for both of them. Additionally, extensive experiments based on real-world datasets are conducted to verify the desirable properties of the proposed mechanisms."
Generalized Score Functions for Causal Discovery,"Discovery of causal relationships from observational data is a fundamental problem. Roughly speaking, there are two types of methods for causal discovery, constraint-based ones and score-based ones. Score-based methods avoid the multiple testing problem and enjoy certain advantages compared to constraint-based ones. However, most of them need strong assumptions on the functional forms of causal mechanisms, as well as on data distributions, which limit their applicability. In practice the precise information of the underlying model class is usually unknown. If the above assumptions are violated, both spurious and missing edges may result. In this paper, we introduce generalized score functions for causal discovery based on the characterization of general (conditional) independence relationships between random variables, without assuming particular model classes. In particular, we exploit regression in RKHS to capture the dependence in a nonparametric way. The resulting causal discovery approach produces asymptotically correct results in rather general cases, which may have nonlinear causal mechanisms, a wide class of data distributions, mixed continuous and discrete data, and multidimensional variables. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach."
Accurate and Fast Asymmetric Locality-Sensitive Hashing Scheme for Maximum Inner Product Search,"The problem of Approximate Maximum Inner Product (AMIP) search has received increasing attention due to its wide applications. Interestingly, based on asymmetric transformation, the problem can be reduced to the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, and hence leverage Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to find solution. However, existing asymmetric transformations such as L2-ALSH and XBOX, suffer from large distortion error in reducing AMIP search to ANN search, such that the results of AMIP search can be arbitrarily bad. In this paper, we propose a novel Asymmetric LSH scheme based on Homocentric Hypersphere partition (H2-ALSH) for high-dimensional AMIP search. On the one hand, we propose a novel Query Normalized First (QNF) transformation to significantly reduce the distortion error. On the other hand, by adopting the homocentric hypersphere partition strategy, we can not only improve the search efficiency with early stop pruning, but also get higher search accuracy by further reducing the distortion error with limited data range. Our theoretical studies show that H2-ALSH enjoys a guarantee on search accuracy. Experimental results over four real datasets demonstrate that H2-ALSH significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes."
Active Feature Acquisition with Supervised Matrix Completion,"Feature missing is a serious problem in many applications, which may lead to low quality of training data and further significantly degrade the learning performance. While feature acquisition usually involves special devices or complex process, it is expensive to acquire all feature values for the whole dataset. On the other hand, features may be correlated with each other, and some values may be recovered from the others. It is thus important to decide which features are most informative for recovering the other features as well as improving the learning performance. In this paper, we try to train an effective classification model with least acquisition cost by jointly performing active feature querying and supervised matrix completion. When completing the feature matrix, a novel objective function is proposed to simultaneously minimize the reconstruction error on observed entries and the supervised loss on training data. When querying the feature value, the most uncertain entry is actively selected based on the variance of previous iterations. In addition, a bi-objective optimization method is presented for cost-aware active selection when features bear different acquisition costs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is well validated by both theoretical analysis and experimental study."
Cost-Effective Training of Deep CNNs with Active Model Adaptation,"Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved great success in various applications. However, training an effective DNN model for a specific task is rather challenging because it requires a prior knowledge or experience to design the network architecture, repeated trial-and-error process to tune the parameters, and a large set of labeled data to train the model. In this paper, we propose to overcome these challenges by actively adapting a pre-trained model to a new task with less labeled examples. Specifically, the pre-trained model is iteratively fine tuned based on the most useful examples. The examples are actively selected based on a novel criterion, which jointly estimates the potential contribution of an instance on optimizing the feature representation as well as improving the classification model for the target task. On one hand, the pre-trained model brings plentiful information from its original task, avoiding redesign of the network architecture or training from scratch; and on the other hand, the labeling cost can be significantly reduced by active label querying. Experiments on multiple datasets and different pre-trained models demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve cost-effective training of DNNs."
Variable Selection and Task Grouping for Multi-Task Learning,"We consider multi-task learning, which simultaneously learns related prediction tasks, to improve generalization performance. We factorize a coefficient matrix as the product of two matrices based on a low-rank assumption. These matrices have sparsities to simultaneously perform variable selection and learn and overlapping group structure among the tasks. The resulting bi-convex objective function is minimized by alternating optimization, where sub-problems are solved using alternating direction method of multipliers and accelerated proximal gradient descent. Moreover, we provide the performance bound of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated for both synthetic and real-world datasets."
Concepts-Bridges: Uncovering Conceptual Bridges Based on Biomedical Concept Evolution,"Given two topics of interest (A, C) that are otherwise disconnected - for instance two concepts: a disease (""Migraine"") and a therapeutic substance (""Magnesium"") - this paper attempts to find the conceptual bridges (e.g., serotonin (B)) that connects them in a novel way. This problem of mining implicit linkage is known as hypotheses generation and its potential to accelerate scientific progress is widely recognized. Almost all of the prior studies to tackle this problem ignore the temporal dynamics of concepts. This is limiting because it is known that the semantic meaning of a concept evolves over time. To overcome this issue, in this study, we define this problem as mining time-aware Top-k conceptual bridges, and in doing so provide a systematic approach to formalize the problem. Specifically, the proposed model first extracts relevant entities from the corpus, represents them in time-specific latent spaces, and then further reasons upon it to generate novel and experimentally testable hypotheses. The key challenge in this approach is to learn a mapping function that encodes the temporal characteristics of concepts and aligns the across-time latent spaces. To solve this, we propose an effective algorithm that learns precise mapping sensitive to both global and local semantics of the input query. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations performed on the largest available biomedical corpus substantiate the importance of leveraging the evolutionary semantics of medical concepts and suggests that the generated hypotheses are novel and worthy of clinical trials."
A Treatment Engine by Predicting Next-Period Prescriptions,"Recent years have witnessed an opportunity for improving healthcare efficiency and quality by mining Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). This paper is aimed at developing a treatment engine, which learns from historical EMR data and provides a patient with next-period prescriptions based on disease conditions, laboratory results, and treatment records of the patient. Importantly, the engine takes consideration of both treatment records and physical examination sequences which are not only heterogeneous and temporal in nature but also often with different record frequencies and lengths. Moreover, the engine also combines static information (e.g., demographics) with the temporal sequences to provide personalized treatment prescriptions to patients. In this regard, a novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) learning framework is proposed to model inter-correlations of different types of medical sequences by connections between hidden neurons. With this framework, we develop three multifaceted LSTM models: Fully Connected Heterogeneous LSTM, Partially Connected Heterogeneous LSTM, and Decomposed Heterogeneous LSTM. The experiments are conducted on two datasets: one is the public MIMIC-III ICU data, and the other comes from several Chinese hospitals. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the framework and the three models. The work is deemed important and meaningful for both academia and practitioners in the realm of medical treatment and prediction, as well as in other fields of applications where intelligent decision support becomes pervasive."
Stable Prediction across Unknown Environments,"In many important machine learning applications, the training distribution used to learn a probabilistic classifier differs from the distribution on which the classifier will be used to make predictions. Traditional methods correct the distribution shift by reweighting training data with the ratio of the density between test and training data. However, in many applications training takes place without prior knowledge of the testing distribution. Recently, methods have been proposed to address the shift by learning the underlying causal structure, but those methods rely on diversity arising from multiple training data sets, and they further have complexity limitations in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Global Balancing Regression (DGBR) algorithm to jointly optimize a deep auto-encoder model for feature selection and a global balancing model for stable prediction across unknown environments. The global balancing model constructs balancing weights that facilitate estimation of partial effects of features (holding fixed all other features), a problem that is challenging in high dimensions, and thus helps to identify stable, causal relationships between features and outcomes. The deep auto-encoder model is designed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, thus making global balancing easier. We show, both theoretically and with empirical experiments, that our algorithm can make stable predictions across unknown environments. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for stable prediction across unknown environments."
Learning Dynamics of Decision Boundaries without Additional Labeled Data,"We propose a method for learning the dynamics of the decision boundary to maintain classification performance without additional labeled data. In various applications, such as spam-mail classification, the decision boundary dynamically changes over time. Accordingly, the performance of classifiers deteriorates quickly unless the classifiers are retrained using additional labeled data. However, continuously preparing such data is quite expensive or impossible. The proposed method alleviates this deterioration in performance by using newly obtained unlabeled data, which are easy to prepare, as well as labeled data collected beforehand. With the proposed method, the dynamics of the decision boundary is modeled by Gaussian processes. To exploit information on the decision boundaries from unlabeled data, the low-density separation criterion, i.e., the decision boundary should not cross high-density regions, but instead lie in low-density regions, is assumed with the proposed method. We incorporate this criterion into our framework in a principled manner by introducing the entropy posterior regularization to the posterior of the classifier parameters on the basis of the generic regularized Bayesian framework. We developed an efficient inference algorithm for the model based on variational Bayesian inference. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through experiments using two synthetic and four real-world data sets."
Dual Memory Neural Computer for Asynchronous Two-view Sequential Learning,"One of the core tasks in multi-view learning is to capture relations among views. For sequential data, the relations not only span across views, but also extend throughout the view length to form long-term intra-view and inter-view interactions. In this paper, we present a new memory augmented neural network that aims to model these complex interactions between two asynchronous sequential views. Our model uses two encoders for reading from and writing to two external memories for encoding input views. The intra-view interactions and the long-term dependencies are captured by the use of memories during this encoding process. There are two modes of memory accessing in our system: late-fusion and early-fusion, corresponding to late and early inter-view interactions. In the late-fusion mode, the two memories are separated, containing only view-specific contents. In the early-fusion mode, the two memories share the same addressing space, allowing cross-memory accessing. In both cases, the knowledge from the memories will be combined by a decoder to make predictions over the output space. The resulting dual memory neural computer is demonstrated on a comprehensive set of experiments, including a synthetic task of summing two sequences and the tasks of drug prescription and disease progression in healthcare. The results demonstrate competitive performance over both traditional algorithms and deep learning methods designed for multi-view problems."
A Distributed Quasi-Newton Algorithm for Empirical Risk Minimization with Nonsmooth Regularization,"We propose a communication- and computation-efficient distributed optimization algorithm using second-order information for solving ERM problems with a nonsmooth regularization term. Current second-order and quasi-Newton methods for this problem either do not work well in the distributed setting or work only for specific regularizers. Our algorithm uses successive quadratic approximations, and we describe how to maintain an approximation of the Hessian and solve subproblems efficiently in a distributed manner. The proposed method enjoys global linear convergence for a broad range of non-strongly convex problems that includes the most commonly used ERMs, thus requiring lower communication complexity. It also converges on non-convex problems, so has the potential to be used on applications such as deep learning. Initial computational results on convex problems demonstrate that our method significantly improves on communication cost and running time over the current state-of-the-art methods."
Concentrated Differentially Private Gradient Descent with Adaptive per-Iteration Privacy Budget,"Iterative algorithms, like gradient descent, are common tools for solving a variety of problems, such as model fitting. For this reason, there is interest in creating differentially private versions of them. However, their conversion to differentially private algorithms is often naive. For instance, a fixed number of iterations are chosen, the privacy budget is split evenly among them, and at each iteration, parameters are updated with a noisy gradient.In this paper, we show that gradient-based algorithms can be improved by a more careful allocation of privacy budget per iteration. Intuitively, at the beginning of the optimization, gradients are expected to be large, so that they do not need to be measured as accurately. However, as the parameters approach their optimal values, the gradients decrease and hence need to be measured more accurately. We add a basic line-search capability that helps the algorithm decide when more accurate gradient measurements are necessary.Our gradient descent algorithm works with the recently introduced zCDP version of differential privacy. It outperforms prior algorithms for model fitting and is competitive with the state-of-the-art for $(ε,δ)$-differential privacy, a strictly weaker definition than zCDP."
Graph Classification using Structural Attention,"Graph classification is a problem with practical applications in many different domains. To solve this problem, one usually calculates certain graph statistics (i.e., graph features) that help discriminate between graphs of different classes. When calculating such features, most existing approaches process the entire graph. In a graphlet-based approach, for instance, the entire graph is processed to get the total count of different graphlets or subgraphs. In many real-world applications, however, graphs can be noisy with discriminative patterns confined to certain regions in the graph only. In this work, we study the problem of attention-based graph classification. The use of attention allows us to focus on small but informative parts of the graph, avoiding noise in the rest of the graph. We present a novel RNN model, called the Graph Attention Model (GAM), that processes only a portion of the graph by adaptively selecting a sequence of ""informative"" nodes. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed method is competitive against various well-known methods in graph classification even though our method is limited to only a portion of the graph."
TruePIE: Discovering Reliable Patterns in Pattern-Based Information Extraction,"Pattern-based methods have been successful in information extraction and NLP research. Previous approaches learn the quality of a textual pattern as relatedness to a certain task based on statistics of its individual content (e.g., length, frequency) and hundreds of carefully-annotated labels. However, patterns of good content-quality may generate heavily conflicting information due to the big gap between relatedness and correctness. Evaluating the correctness of information is critical in (entity, attribute, value)-tuple extraction. In this work, we propose a novel method, called TruePIE, that finds reliable patterns which can extract not only related but also correct information. TruePIE adopts the self-training framework and repeats the training-predicting-extracting process to gradually discover more and more reliable patterns. To better represent the textual patterns, pattern embeddings are formulated so that patterns with similar semantic meanings are embedded closely to each other. The embeddings jointly consider the local pattern information and the distributional information of the extractions. To conquer the challenge of lacking supervision on patterns' reliability, TruePIE can automatically generate high quality training patterns based on a couple of seed patterns by applying the arity-constraints to distinguish highly reliable patterns (i.e., positive patterns) and highly unreliable patterns (i.e., negative patterns). Experiments on a huge news dataset (over 25GB) demonstrate that the proposed TruePIE significantly outperforms baseline methods on each of the three tasks: reliable tuple extraction, reliable pattern extraction, and negative pattern extraction."
Offline Evaluation of Ranking Policies with Click Models,"Many web systems rank and present a list of items to users, from recommender systems to search and advertising. An important problem in practice is to evaluate new ranking policies offline and optimize them before they are deployed. We address this problem by proposing evaluation algorithms for estimating the expected number of clicks on ranked lists from historical logged data. The existing algorithms are not guaranteed to be statistically efficient in our problem because the number of recommended lists can grow exponentially with their length. To overcome this challenge, we use models of user interaction with the list of items, the so-called click models, to construct estimators that learn statistically efficiently. We analyze our estimators and prove that they are more efficient than the estimators that do not use the structure of the click model, under the assumption that the click model holds. We evaluate our estimators in a series of experiments on a real-world dataset and show that they consistently outperform prior estimators."
Multi-task Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation,"One crucial task in intelligent transportation systems is estimating the duration of a potential trip given the origin location, destination location as well as the departure time. Most existing approaches for travel time estimation assume that the route of the trip is given, which does not hold in real-world applications since the route can be dynamically changed due to traffic conditions, user preferences, etc. As inferring the path from the origin and the destination can be time-consuming and nevertheless error-prone, it is desirable to perform origin-destination travel time estimation, which aims to predict the travel time without online route information. This problem is challenging mainly due to its limited amount of information available and the complicated spatiotemporal dependency. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-task Representation learning model for Arrival Time estimation (MURAT). This model produces meaningful representation that preserves various trip properties in the real-world and at the same time leverages the underlying road network and the spatiotemporal prior knowledge. Further-more, we propose a multi-task learning framework to utilize the path information of historical trips during the training phase which boosts the performance. Experimental results on two large-scale real-world datasets show that the proposed approach achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods"
An Efficient Two-Layer Mechanism for Privacy-Preserving Truth Discovery,"Soliciting answers from online users is an efficient and effective solution to many challenging tasks. Due to the variety in the quality of users, it is important to infer their ability to provide correct answers during aggregation. Therefore, truth discovery methods can be used to automatically capture the user quality and aggregate user-contributed answers via a weighted combination. Despite the fact that truth discovery is an effective tool for answer aggregation, existing work falls short of the protection towards the privacy of participating users. To fill this gap, we propose perturbation-based mechanisms that provide users with privacy guarantees and maintain the accuracy of aggregated answers. We first present a one-layer mechanism, in which all the users adopt the same probability to perturb their answers. Aggregation is then conducted on perturbed answers but the aggregation accuracy could drop accordingly. To improve the utility, a two-layer mechanism is proposed where users are allowed to sample their own probabilities from a hyper distribution. We theoretically compare the one-layer and two-layer mechanisms, and prove that they provide the same privacy guarantee while the two-layer mechanism delivers better utility. This advantage is brought by the fact that the two-layer mechanism can utilize the estimated user quality information from truth discovery to reduce the accuracy loss caused by perturbation, which is confirmed by experimental results on real-world datasets. Experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-layer mechanism in privacy protection with tolerable accuracy loss in aggregation."
Learning Adversarial Networks for Semi-Supervised Text Classification via Policy Gradient,"Semi-supervised learning is a branch of machine learning techniques that aims to make fully use of both labeled and unlabeled instances to improve the prediction performance. The size of modern real world datasets is ever-growing so that acquiring label information for them is extraordinarily difficult and costly. Therefore, deep semi-supervised learning is becoming more and more popular. Most of the existing deep semi-supervised learning methods are built under the generative model based scheme, where the data distribution is approximated via input data reconstruction. However, this scheme does not naturally work on discrete data, e.g., text; in addition, learning a good data representation is sometimes directly opposed to the goal of learning a high performance prediction model. To address the issues of this type of methods, we reformulate the semi-supervised learning as a model-based reinforcement learning problem and propose an adversarial networks based framework. The proposed framework contains two networks: a predictor network for target estimation and a judge network for evaluation. The judge network iteratively generates proper reward to guide the training of predictor network, and the predictor network is trained via policy gradient. Based on the aforementioned framework, we propose a recurrent neural network based model for semi-supervised text classification. We conduct comprehensive experimental analysis on several real world benchmark text datasets, and the results from our evaluations show that our method outperforms other competing state-of-the-art methods."
Dynamic Bike Reposition: A Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Bike-sharing systems are widely deployed in many major cities, while the jammed and empty stations in them lead to severe customer loss. Currently, operators try to constantly reposition bikes among stations when the system is operating. However, how to efficiently reposition to minimize the customer loss in a long period remains unsolved. We propose a spatio-temporal reinforcement learning based bike reposition model to deal with this problem. Firstly, an inter-independent inner-balance clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster stations into groups. Clusters obtained have two properties, i.e. each cluster is inner-balanced and independent from the others. As there are many trikes repositioning in a very large system simultaneously, clustering is necessary to reduce the problem complexity. Secondly, we allocate multiple trikes to each cluster to conduct inner-cluster bike reposition. A spatio-temporal reinforcement learning model is designed for each cluster to learn a reposition policy in it, targeting at minimizing its customer loss in a long period. To learn each model, we design a deep neural network to estimate its optimal long-term value function, from which the optimal policy can be easily inferred. Besides formulating the model in a multi-agent way, we further reduce its training complexity by two spatio-temporal pruning rules. Thirdly, we design a system simulator based on two predictors to train and evaluate the reposition model. Experiments on real-world datasets from Citi Bike are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of our model."
Learning from History and Present: Next-item Recommendation via Discriminatively Exploiting User Behaviors,"In the modern e-commerce, the behaviors of customers contain rich information, e.g., consumption habits, the dynamics of preferences. Recently, session-based recommendationsare becoming popular to explore the temporal characteristics of customers' interactive behaviors. However, existing works mainly exploit the short-term behaviors without fully taking the customers' long-term stable preferences and evolutions into account. In this paper, we propose a novel Behavior-Intensive Neural Network (BINN) for next-item recommendation by incorporating both users' historical stable preferences and present consumption motivations. Specifically, BINN contains two main components, i.e., Neural Item Embedding, and Discriminative Behaviors Learning. Firstly, a novel item embedding method based on user interactions is developed for obtaining an unified representation for each item. Then, with the embedded items and the interactive behaviors over item sequences, BINN discriminatively learns the historical preferences and present motivations of the target users. Thus, BINN could better perform recommendations of the next items for the target users. Finally, for evaluating the performances of BINN, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, i.e., Tianchi and JD. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of BINN compared with several state-of-the-art methods."
High-order Proximity Preserving Information Network Hashing,"Information network embedding is an effective way for efficient graph analytics. However, it still faces with computational challenges in problems such as link prediction and node recommendation, particularly with increasing scale of networks. Hashing is a promising approach for accelerating these problems by orders of magnitude. However, no prior studies have been focused on seeking binary codes for information networks to preserve high-order proximity. Since matrix factorization (MF) unifies and outperforms several well-known embedding methods with high-order proximity preserved, we propose a MF-based \underlineI nformation \underlineN etwork \underlineH ashing (INH-MF) algorithm, to learn binary codes which can preserve high-order proximity. We also suggest Hamming subspace learning, which only updates partial binary codes each time, to scale up INH-MF. We finally evaluate INH-MF on four real-world information network datasets with respect to the tasks of node classification and node recommendation. The results demonstrate that INH-MF can perform significantly better than competing learning to hash baselines in both tasks, and surprisingly outperforms network embedding methods, including DeepWalk, LINE and NetMF, in the task of node recommendation. The source code of INH-MF is available online\footnote\urlhttps://github.com/DefuLian/network ."
xDeepFM: Combining Explicit and Implicit Feature Interactions for Recommender Systems,"Combinatorial features are essential for the success of many commercial models. Manually crafting these features usually comes with high cost due to the variety, volume and velocity of raw data in web-scale systems. Factorization based models, which measure interactions in terms of vector product, can learn patterns of combinatorial features automatically and generalize to unseen features as well. With the great success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various fields, recently researchers have proposed several DNN-based factorization model to learn both low- and high-order feature interactions. Despite the powerful ability of learning an arbitrary function from data, plain DNNs generate feature interactions implicitly and at the bit-wise level. In this paper, we propose a novel Compressed Interaction Network (CIN), which aims to generate feature interactions in an explicit fashion and at the vector-wise level. We show that the CIN share some functionalities with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We further combine a CIN and a classical DNN into one unified model, and named this new model eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM). On one hand, the xDeepFM is able to learn certain bounded-degree feature interactions explicitly; on the other hand, it can learn arbitrary low- and high-order feature interactions implicitly. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that xDeepFM outperforms state-of-the-art models. We have released the source code of xDeepFM at https://github.com/Leavingseason/xDeepFM."
Dynamic Embeddings for User Profiling in Twitter,"In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic user profiling in Twitter. We address the problem by proposing a dynamic user and word embedding model (DUWE), a scalable black-box variational inference algorithm, and a streaming keyword diversification model (SKDM). DUWE dynamically tracks the semantic representations of users and words over time and models their embeddings in the same space so that their similarities can be effectively measured. Our inference algorithm works with a convex objective function that ensures the robustness of the learnt embeddings. SKDM aims at retrieving top-K relevant and diversified keywords to profile users' dynamic interests. Experiments on a Twitter dataset demonstrate that our proposed embedding algorithms outperform state-of-the-art non-dynamic and dynamic embedding and topic models."
Efficient Large-Scale Fleet Management via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Large-scale online ride-sharing platforms have substantially transformed our lives by reallocating transportation resources to alleviate traffic congestion and promote transportation efficiency. An efficient fleet management strategy not only can significantly improve the utilization of transportation resources but also increase the revenue and customer satisfaction. It is a challenging task to design an effective fleet management strategy that can adapt to an environment involving complex dynamics between demand and supply. Existing studies usually work on a simplified problem setting that can hardly capture the complicated stochastic demand-supply variations in high-dimensional space. In this paper we propose to tackle the large-scale fleet management problem using reinforcement learning, and propose a contextual multi-agent reinforcement learning framework including two concrete algorithms, namely contextual deep Q-learning and contextual multi-agent actor-critic, to achieve explicit coordination among a large number of agents adaptive to different contexts. We show significant improvements of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art approaches through extensive empirical studies."
Enhancing Predictive Modeling of Nested Spatial Data through Group-Level Feature Disaggregation,"Multilevel modeling and multi-task learning are two widely used approaches for modeling nested (multi-level) data, which contain observations that can be clustered into groups, characterized by their group-level features. Despite the similarity of the problems they address, the explicit relationship between multilevel modeling and multi-task learning has not been carefully examined. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis between the two methods to illustrate their strengths and limitations when applied to two-level nested data. We provide a detailed analysis demonstrating the equivalence of their formulations under a mild condition from an optimization perspective. We also demonstrate their limitations in terms of their predictive performance and especially, their difficulty in identifying potential cross-scale interactions between the local and group-level features when applied to datasets with either a small number of groups or limited training examples per group. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method for disaggregating the coarse-scale values of the group-level features in the nested data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show that the disaggregated group-level features can help enhance the prediction accuracy of the models significantly and identify the cross-scale interactions more effectively."
Content to Node: Self-Translation Network Embedding,"This paper concerns the problem of network embedding (NE), whose aim is to learn low-dimensional representations for nodes in networks. Such dense vector representations offer great promises for many network analysis problems. However, existing NE approaches are still faced with challenges posed by the characteristics of complex networks in real-world applications. First, for many real-world networks associated with rich content information, previous NE methods tend to learn separated content and structure representations for each node, which requires a post-processing of combination. The empirical and simple combination strategies often make the final vector suboptimal. Second, the existing NE methods preserve the structure information by considering short and fixed neighborhood scope, such as the first- and/or the second-order proximities. However, it is hard to decide the scope of the neighborhood when facing a complex problem. To this end, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model based NE framework which is referred to as Self-Translation Network Embedding (STNE) model. With the sequences generated by random walks on a network, STNE learns the mapping that translates each sequence itself from the content sequence to the node sequence. On the one hand, the bi-directional LSTM encoder of STNE fuses the content and structure information seamlessly from the raw input. On the other hand, high-order proximity can be flexibly learned with the memories of LSTM to capture long-range structural information. By such self-translation from content to node, the learned hidden representations can be adopted as node embeddings. Extensive experimental results based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed STNE outperforms the state-of-the-art NE approaches. To facilitate reproduction and further study, we provide Internet access to the code and datasets\footnotehttp://dm.nankai.edu.cn/code/STNE.rar."
Adversarial Detection with Model Interpretation,"Machine learning (ML) systems have been increasingly applied in web security applications such as spammer detection, malware detection and fraud detection. These applications have an intrinsic adversarial nature where intelligent attackers can adaptively change their behaviors to avoid being detected by the deployed detectors. Existing efforts against adversaries are usually limited by the type of applied ML models or the specific applications such as image classification. Additionally, the working mechanisms of ML models usually cannot be well understood by users, which in turn impede them from understanding the vulnerabilities of models nor improving their robustness. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose to investigate whether model interpretation could potentially help adversarial detection. Specifically, we develop a novel adversary-resistant detection framework by utilizing the interpretation of ML models. The interpretation process explains the mechanism of how the target ML model makes prediction for a given instance, thus providing more insights for crafting adversarial samples. The robustness of detectors is then improved through adversarial training with the adversarial samples. A data-driven method is also developed to empirically estimate costs of adversaries in feature manipulation. Our approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to various types of classification models. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of interpretation-based attacks and how estimated feature manipulation cost would affect the behavior of adversaries."
On Interpretation of Network Embedding via Taxonomy Induction,"Network embedding has been increasingly used in many network analytics applications to generate low-dimensional vector representations, so that many off-the-shelf models can be applied to solve a wide variety of data mining tasks. However, similar to many other machine learning methods, network embedding results remain hard to be understood by users. Each dimension in the embedding space usually does not have any specific meaning, thus it is difficult to comprehend how the embedding instances are distributed in the reconstructed space. In addition, heterogeneous content information may be incorporated into network embedding, so it is challenging to specify which source of information is effective in generating the embedding results. In this paper, we investigate the interpretation of network embedding, aiming to understand how instances are distributed in embedding space, as well as explore the factors that lead to the embedding results. We resort to the post-hoc interpretation scheme, so that our approach can be applied to different types of embedding methods. Specifically, the interpretation of network embedding is presented in the form of a taxonomy. Effective objectives and corresponding algorithms are developed towards building the taxonomy. We also design several metrics to evaluate interpretation results. Experiments on real-world datasets from different domains demonstrate that, by comparing with the state-of-the-art alternatives, our approach produces effective and meaningful interpretation to embedding results."
Finding Similar Exercises in Online Education Systems,"In online education systems, finding similar exercises is a fundamental task of many applications, such as exercise retrieval and student modeling. Several approaches have been proposed for this task by simply using the specific textual content (e.g. the same knowledge concepts or the similar words) in exercises. However, the problem of how to systematically exploit the rich semantic information embedded in multiple heterogenous data (e.g. texts and images) to precisely retrieve similar exercises remains pretty much open. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel Multimodal Attention-based Neural Network (MANN) framework for finding similar exercises in large-scale online education systems by learning a unified semantic representation from the heterogenous data. In MANN, given exercises with texts, images and knowledge concepts, we first apply a convolutional neural network to extract image representations and use an embedding layer for representing concepts. Then, we design an attention-based long short-term memory network to learn a unified semantic representation of each exercise in a multimodal way. Here, two attention strategies are proposed to capture the associations of texts and images, texts and knowledge concepts, respectively. Moreover, with a Similarity Attention, the similar parts in each exercise pair are also measured. Finally, we develop a pairwise training strategy for returning similar exercises. Extensive experimental results on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness and the interpretation power of MANN."
STAMP: Short-Term Attention/Memory Priority Model for Session-based Recommendation,"Predicting users' actions based on anonymous sessions is a challenging problem in web-based behavioral modeling research, mainly due to the uncertainty of user behavior and the limited information. Recent advances in recurrent neural networks have led to promising approaches to solving this problem, with long short-term memory model proving effective in capturing users' general interests from previous clicks. However, none of the existing approaches explicitly take the effects of users' current actions on their next moves into account. In this study, we argue that a long-term memory model may be insufficient for modeling long sessions that usually contain user interests drift caused by unintended clicks. A novel short-term attention/memory priority model is proposed as a remedy, which is capable of capturing users' general interests from the long-term memory of a session context, whilst taking into account users' current interests from the short-term memory of the last-clicks. The validity and efficacy of the proposed attention mechanism is extensively evaluated on three benchmark data sets from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and CIKM Cup 2016. The numerical results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in all the tests."
Active Opinion Maximization in Social Networks,"Influence maximization (IM) targets at maximizing the number of users being aware of a product by finding a set of seed users to expose in a social network. Previous IM models mainly focus on optimizing the spread of product consumption, which assumes that all users are potential customers and more exposures lead to better profit. However, in the real-world scenario, some people may not like the product and may express negative opinions after consuming, which damage the product reputation and harm the long-term profit. Only a portion of users in the social network, called the target user, is the potential customer that likes the product and will spread positive opinion. In this paper, we consider a problem called AcTive Opinion Maximization (ATOM), where the goal is to find a set of seed users to maximize the overall opinion spread toward a target product in a multi-round campaign. Different from previous works, we do not assume the user opinion is known before consumption, but should be derived from user preference data. The ATOM problem has essential applications in viral marketing, such as reputation building and precision advertising. Given its significance, ATOM problem is profoundly challenging due to the hardness of estimating user opinion in a multi-round campaign. Moreover, the process of opinion estimation and influence propagation intertwine with each other, which requires the model to consider the two components collectively. We propose an active learning framework called CONE (aCtive OpinioN Estimator) to address above challenges. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CONE improves the total opinion spread in a social network."
Efficient Similar Region Search with Deep Metric Learning,"With the proliferation of mobile devices and location-based services, rich geo-tagged data is becoming prevalent and this offer great opportunities to understand different geographical regions (e.g., shopping areas). However, the huge number of regions with complicated spatial information are expensive for people to explore and understand. To solve this issue, we study the problem of searching similar regions given a user specified query region. The problem is challenging in both similarity definition and search efficiency. To tackle the two challenges, we propose a novel solution equipped by (1) a deep learning approach to learning the similarity that considers both object attributes and the relative locations between objects; and (2) an efficient branch and bound search algorithm for finding top-N similar regions. Moreover, we propose an approximation method to further improve the efficiency by slightly sacrificing the accuracy. Our experiments on three real world datasets demonstrate that our solution improves both the accuracy and search efficiency by a significant margin compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
Interactive Paths Embedding for Semantic Proximity Search on Heterogeneous Graphs,"Semantic proximity search on heterogeneous graph is an important task, and is useful for many applications. It aims to measure the proximity between two nodes on a heterogeneous graph w.r.t. some given semantic relation. Prior work often tries to measure the semantic proximity by paths connecting a query object and a target object. Despite the success of such path-based approaches, they often modeled the paths in a weakly coupled manner, which overlooked the rich interactions among paths. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of interactive paths to model the inter-dependency among multiple paths between a query object and a target object. We then propose an Interactive Paths Embedding (IPE) model, which learns low-dimensional representations for the resulting interactive-paths structures for proximity estimation. We conduct experiments on seven relations with four different types of heterogeneous graphs, and show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines."
Context-aware Academic Collaborator Recommendation,"Collaborator Recommendation is a useful application in exploiting big academic data. However, existing works leave out the contextual restriction (i.e., research topics) of people's academic collaboration, thus cannot recommend suitable collaborators for the required research topics. In this work, we propose Context-aware Collaborator Recommendation (CACR), which aims to recommend high-potential new collaborators for people's context-restricted requests. To this end, we design a novel recommendation framework, which consists of two fundamental components: the Collaborative Entity Embedding network (CEE) and the Hierarchical Factorization Model (HFM). In particular, CEE jointly represents researchers and research topics as compact vectors based on their co-occurrence relationships, whereby capturing researchers' context-aware collaboration tendencies and topics' underlying semantics. Meanwhile, HFM extracts researchers' activenesses and conservativenesses, which reflect their intensities of making academic collaborations and tendencies of working with non-collaborated fellows. The extracted activenesses and conservativenesses work collaboratively with the context-aware collaboration tendencies, such that high-quality recommendation can be produced. Extensive experimental studies are conducted with large-scale academic data, whose results verify the effectiveness of our proposed approaches."
R-VQA: Learning Visual Relation Facts with Semantic Attention for Visual Question Answering,"Recently, Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as one of the most significant tasks in multimodal learning as it requires understanding both visual and textual modalities. Existing methods mainly rely on extracting image and question features to learn their joint feature embedding via multimodal fusion or attention mechanism. Some recent studies utilize external VQA-independent models to detect candidate entities or attributes in images, which serve as semantic knowledge complementary to the VQA task. However, these candidate entities or attributes might be unrelated to the VQA task and have limited semantic capacities. To better utilize semantic knowledge in images, we propose a novel framework to learn visual relation facts for VQA. Specifically, we build up a Relation-VQA (R-VQA) dataset based on the Visual Genome dataset via a semantic similarity module, in which each data consists of an image, a corresponding question, a correct answer and a supporting relation fact. A well-defined relation detector is then adopted to predict visual question-related relation facts. We further propose a multi-step attention model composed of visual attention and semantic attention sequentially to extract related visual knowledge and semantic knowledge. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the two benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and verifying the benefit of considering visual relation facts."
TINET: Learning Invariant Networks via Knowledge Transfer,"The latent behavior of an information system that can exhibit extreme events, such as system faults or cyber-attacks, is complex. Recently, the invariant network has shown to be a powerful way of characterizing complex system behaviors. Structures and evolutions of the invariance network, in particular, the vanishing correlations, can shed light on identifying causal anomalies and performing system diagnosis. However, due to the dynamic and complex nature of real-world information systems, learning a reliable invariant network in a new environment often requires continuous collecting and analyzing the system surveillance data for several weeks or even months. Although the invariant networks learned from old environments have some common entities and entity relationships, these networks cannot be directly borrowed for the new environment due to the domain variety problem. To avoid the prohibitive time and resource consuming network building process, we propose TINET, a knowledge transfer based model for accelerating invariant network construction. In particular, we first propose an entity estimation model to estimate the probability of each source domain entity that can be included in the final invariant network of the target domain. Then, we propose a dependency construction model for constructing the unbiased dependency relationships by solving a two-constraint optimization problem. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TINET. We also apply TINET to a real enterprise security system for intrusion detection. TINET achieves superior detection performance at least 20 days lead-lag time in advance with more than 75% accuracy."
Sketched Follow-The-Regularized-Leader for Online Factorization Machine,"Factorization Machine (FM) is a supervised machine learning model for feature engineering, which is widely used in many real-world applications. In this paper, we consider the case that the data samples arrive sequentially. The existing convex formulation for online FM has the strong theoretical guarantee and stable performance in practice, but the computational cost is typically expensive when the data is high-dimensional. To address this weakness, we devise a novel online learning algorithm called Sketched Follow-The-Regularizer-Leader (SFTRL). SFTRL presents the parameters of FM implicitly by maintaining low-rank matrices and updates the parameters via sketching. More specifically, we propose Generalized Frequent Directions to approximate indefinite symmetric matrices in a streaming way, making that the sum of historical gradients for FM could be estimated with tighter error bound efficiently. With mild assumptions, we prove that the regret bound of SFTRL is close to that of the standard FTRL. Experimental results show that SFTRL has better prediction quality than the state-of-the-art online FM algorithms in much lower time and space complexities."
Risk Prediction on Electronic Health Records with Prior Medical Knowledge,"Predicting the risk of potential diseases from Electronic Health Records (EHR) has attracted considerable attention in recent years, especially with the development of deep learning techniques. Compared with traditional machine learning models, deep learning based approaches achieve superior performance on risk prediction task. However, none of existing work explicitly takes prior medical knowledge (such as the relationships between diseases and corresponding risk factors) into account. In medical domain, knowledge is usually represented by discrete and arbitrary rules. Thus, how to integrate such medical rules into existing risk prediction models to improve the performance is a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel and general framework called PRIME for risk prediction task, which can successfully incorporate discrete prior medical knowledge into all of the state-of-the-art predictive models using posterior regularization technique. Different from traditional posterior regularization, we do not need to manually set a bound for each piece of prior medical knowledge when modeling desired distribution of the target disease on patients. Moreover, the proposed PRIME can automatically learn the importance of different prior knowledge with a log-linear model.Experimental results on three real medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for the task of risk prediction"
Hierarchical Taxonomy Aware Network Embedding,"Network embedding learns the low-dimensional representations for vertices, while preserving the inter-vertex similarity reflected by the network structure. The neighborhood structure of a vertex is usually closely related with an underlying hierarchical taxonomy---the vertices are associated with successively broader categories that can be organized hierarchically. The categories of different levels reflects similarity of different granularity. The hierarchy of the taxonomy therefore requires that the learned representations support multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, the hierarchical taxonomy enables the information to flow between vertices via their common categories, and thus provides an effective mechanism for alleviating data scarcity. However, incorporating the hierarchical taxonomy into network embedding poses a great challenge (since the taxonomy is generally unknown), and it is neglected by the existing approaches. In this paper, we propose NetHiex, a NETwork embedding model that captures the latent HIErarchical taXonomy. In our model, a vertex representation consists of multiple components that are associated with categories of different granularity. The representations of both the vertices and the categories are co-regularized. We employ the nested Chinese restaurant process to guide the search of the most plausible hierarchical taxonomy. The network structure is then recovered from the latent representations via a Bernoulli distribution. The whole model is unified within a nonparametric probabilistic framework. A scalable expectation-maximization algorithm is derived for optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that NetHiex achieves significant performance gain over the state-of-arts."
Modeling Task Relationships in Multi-task Learning with Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts,"Neural-based multi-task learning has been successfully used in many real-world large-scale applications such as recommendation systems. For example, in movie recommendations, beyond providing users movies which they tend to purchase and watch, the system might also optimize for users liking the movies afterwards. With multi-task learning, we aim to build a single model that learns these multiple goals and tasks simultaneously. However, the prediction quality of commonly used multi-task models is often sensitive to the relationships between tasks. It is therefore important to study the modeling tradeoffs between task-specific objectives and inter-task relationships. In this work, we propose a novel multi-task learning approach, Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE), which explicitly learns to model task relationships from data. We adapt the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure to multi-task learning by sharing the expert submodels across all tasks, while also having a gating network trained to optimize each task. To validate our approach on data with different levels of task relatedness, we first apply it to a synthetic dataset where we control the task relatedness. We show that the proposed approach performs better than baseline methods when the tasks are less related. We also show that the MMoE structure results in an additional trainability benefit, depending on different levels of randomness in the training data and model initialization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance improvements by MMoE on real tasks including a binary classification benchmark, and a large-scale content recommendation system at Google."
